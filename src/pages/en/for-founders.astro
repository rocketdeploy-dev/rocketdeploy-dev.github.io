    <p class="lead">
      Not sure how to turn it into a working product?
      We help you go from idea to a real, working first version —
      without technical chaos and without guessing “what now”.

        Tell us briefly what you want to build and what context you’re coming from.
        We’ll get back to you with a reasonable next step.

      <p style="margin-top:0; color: rgba(255,255,255,.72);">
        It’s normal that you’re not technical, don’t know where to start,
        don’t have a technical team, and worry about costs or wrong decisions.
        Most solid products start exactly here.

      <p style="margin-bottom:0; color: rgba(255,255,255,.72);">
        Our role is not to overwhelm you with details, but to help structure the idea
        and guide you through the entire process in a clear, understandable way.

        For founders and teams who have an idea for a product, platform, or system,
        want to validate its business sense, don’t have a CTO or technical team,
        and want to deliver something real — not just a “project”.

        We take responsibility for technical decisions, system architecture,

      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:0; color: rgba(255,255,255,.72);">
        You don’t need to “learn IT”. We explain things in plain language
        and make decisions together.

        We don’t sell fixed “packages”, don’t promise miracles in a week,
