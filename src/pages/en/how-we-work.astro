    <h1>How we work</h1>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        We work in a delivery model — with clear scope, a predictable process, and ownership of outcomes. From day one, we build with production and real-world usage in mind.

    <h2>First engagement</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        For initial projects, we typically work via selected freelance platforms. They provide clear scope, escrow-based payments, and a structured delivery process — which helps keep things secure and predictable for both sides.

    <h2>Ongoing partnership</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        For long-term, proven collaborations, we’re happy to move to direct contracts and billing. Once the delivery rhythm and ways of working are established, we simplify the formalities and operate more directly.
