      <p style="margin-top:0; color: rgba(255,255,255,.72);">
        We work in a delivery model — with clear scope and a predictable process,
        focused on bringing systems to production. From day one, we build with
        real-world usage in mind. In day-to-day work, we consciously use modern tools supported by AI —
        as an accelerator of experience, not a replacement for it.

        For initial projects, we typically work via selected freelance platforms.
        They provide clear scope, escrow-based payments, and a structured
        delivery process — helping keep things secure and predictable
        for both sides.

    <h2>Ongoing partnership</h2>

      <p style="margin-top:0; color: rgba(255,255,255,.72);">
        For long-term, proven collaborations, we’re happy to move to direct
        contracts and billing. Once the delivery cadence and ways of working
        are established, we simplify the formalities and operate more directly.

        the next step is a short conversation or a closer look
        at the areas where we can help.
