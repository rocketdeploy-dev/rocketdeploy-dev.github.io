        Below you’ll find answers to the most common questions about working
        with RocketDeploy — scope, collaboration model, and next steps.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>general</h2>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Do you work on small projects?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. We handle both small, well-defined tasks and larger systems
          delivered incrementally.
          A small project is often the first step toward a longer collaboration.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Do I need to know exactly what I want?</h3>
        <p>
          No. A high-level goal and business context are enough.
          We help refine the scope, technical assumptions,
          and propose a reasonable delivery plan.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Do you use AI in your work?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. We treat AI-supported tools as a natural part of a modern engineering toolkit.
          What really matters is <em>how</em> they are used — only in the hands of experienced engineers
          do they truly shorten delivery time, improve decision quality and raise the overall delivery standard.

  <section class="section">
    <h2>scope and responsibility</h2>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Do you provide system maintenance?</h3>
        <p>
          We do not take over maintenance of third-party systems.
          We only offer a limited stabilization phase
          for systems we designed and delivered ourselves.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Do you offer 24/7 support?</h3>
        <p>
          No. We do not operate a 24/7 on-call or classic support model.
          Collaboration is based on agreed availability hours
          and clearly defined response times.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Can I commission only a part of the work?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. You can commission full end-to-end delivery
          or selected areas only —
          for example architecture design, infrastructure,
          or production deployment.

    <h2>collaboration model</h2>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>How does collaboration usually start?</h3>
        <p>
          We start with a short message describing your goal and context.
          Then we refine the scope and propose a solution
          along with a milestone-based delivery plan.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Do you work via platforms like Upwork or Freelancer?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. For initial projects, we often use freelance platforms
          that provide escrow payments, clear scope,
          and a structured collaboration process.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Is direct collaboration possible?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes. For longer, proven collaborations,
          we move to direct contracts and billing.
