## System context

The project focused on designing and implementing a **company website** that serves as both a public-facing presence and a long-term knowledge base for technical case studies.

The site is not treated as a simple marketing landing page.

Instead, it functions as:
- a **content-driven system** for publishing structured case studies,
- a reference point for architectural thinking and delivery approach,
- a fast, predictable frontend with minimal runtime complexity.

From the beginning, the website was designed to be:
- static-first,
- easy to evolve without rewrites,
- fully inspectable and transparent at the code level.

---

## Core challenges

### 1. Treating the website as a system, not a page

Although the output is “just a website”, the requirements went beyond visual presentation.

The system had to:
- support long-form technical content,
- handle multiple locales and canonical URLs,
- enforce consistent structure across pages,
- remain fast regardless of content growth.

This required treating the website as a **small but real frontend system**, not a collection of static pages.

---

### 2. Content authoring without sacrificing structure

A key challenge was balancing:
- flexibility for writing and editing content,
- structural guarantees required for long-term maintenance.

Case studies needed:
- consistent metadata,
- predictable layout and navigation,
- the ability to evolve independently over time.

Free-form HTML or CMS-driven content was intentionally avoided in favor of a **structured, schema-driven content layer**.

---

### 3. Performance as a non-negotiable constraint

The website acts as a first point of contact.

Key constraints included:
- fast initial load,
- minimal JavaScript execution,
- predictable rendering behavior.

This ruled out runtime-heavy solutions and pushed the architecture toward **build-time rendering and static delivery**.

---

### 4. Long-term evolution without rewrites

The site is expected to grow:
- new case studies,
- additional content sections,
- potential future variants of the same architecture.

The challenge was to design a system that:
- allows incremental content growth,
- keeps architectural boundaries intact,
- avoids framework lock-in at the content level.

---

## Architectural approach

The website was designed as a **static, content-driven frontend system** with a clear separation of concerns.

### High-level structure:
- **Entry routing layer** – responsible for locale selection and canonical routing.
- **Page routes** – locale-specific routes rendering structured content.
- **Content layer** – schema-validated MDX collections defining case studies and pages.
- **Layout shell** – shared layout responsible for metadata, navigation, and styling.
- **Minimal runtime layer** – small, isolated client-side helpers only where necessary.

This structure keeps the system:
- predictable,
- easy to reason about,
- resilient to content growth.

---

## Content and presentation model

Content is authored using **MDX** and validated at build time.

Key characteristics:
- each case study is a structured content entry,
- metadata is explicit and enforced,
- presentation logic is kept separate from content authoring.

This allows:
- technical content to be edited without touching layout code,
- layout changes without rewriting content,
- consistent rendering across the site.

---

## UI and visual consistency

The visual layer emphasizes:
- clarity over decoration,
- consistent information hierarchy,
- readability for long-form technical content.

    }
  ]}

## Runtime behavior and execution model

The runtime surface of the site is intentionally minimal.

- pages are rendered entirely at build time,
- no client-side state store is used,
- JavaScript is limited to small, purpose-built helpers.

Runtime logic includes:
- locale detection and redirect,
- small UX enhancements (e.g. copy-to-clipboard).

There is no server-side runtime or backend dependency.

---

## Reliability and security considerations

The static-first model provides:
- predictable delivery via static assets,
- minimal attack surface,
- no runtime secrets or credentials.

Build-time validation ensures:
- invalid content is caught early,
- broken routes are detected before deployment.

External links and navigation boundaries are handled explicitly to avoid unintended side effects.

---

## Current state and evolution

The current implementation is stable and actively used.

The system supports:
- publishing new case studies without architectural changes,
- incremental layout refinements,
- extension of content collections.

Future evolution is expected to:
- preserve the static-first execution model,
- avoid introducing runtime coupling,
- reuse the same architectural approach across additional websites.

---

## Final outcome

The result is a **production-grade company website architecture** that:
- treats content as a first-class system concern,
- prioritizes performance and predictability,
- remains easy to evolve over time.

This case study demonstrates how even a “simple” company website
can benefit from **explicit architectural thinking** and disciplined execution.
