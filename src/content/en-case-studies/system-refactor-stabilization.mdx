## Initial situation

The system was already live in production,
but increasing business complexity
made it harder to maintain and evolve.

Symptoms included:
- slow development,
- unpredictable failures,
- increasing deployment risk.

---

## Approach

Instead of a full rewrite,
an **evolutionary refactor** was applied.

Key priorities were:
- uninterrupted operation,
- gradual responsibility separation,
- improving observability before major changes.

---

## Execution

The process involved:
- identifying critical domains,
- introducing clear API contracts,
- extracting components step by step,
- validating changes in production.

---

## Outcome

The system became:
- more stable,
- easier to evolve,
- operationally predictable.

The transformation was completed
without production downtime.
