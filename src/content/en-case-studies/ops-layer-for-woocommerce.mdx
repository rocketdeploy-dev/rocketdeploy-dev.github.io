## System context

The project focused on extending an e-commerce platform with an **advanced operational layer**, used daily by teams responsible for order fulfillment, logistics, and internal processes.

The starting point was a system based on **WooCommerce**, which:
- handled sales well,
- was not designed for complex operational workflows,
- assumed that all users would work inside **WordPress admin**.

In practice, this proved insufficient.  
Operational teams:
- were non-technical,
- worked in different contexts (office, field, transport),
- should not have access to the full CMS backend,
- needed **dedicated tools** tailored to their daily work.

The goal was to build an **independent operational layer**, deeply integrated with WooCommerce, yet **separated from the standard WordPress admin interface**.

---

## Core challenges

### 1. WooCommerce as a data source, not a work interface

The system needed to:
- consume WooCommerce data and events,
- react to order status changes,
- remain fully compatible with the WP/WC ecosystem,

while **not forcing operational teams to work in WordPress admin**.

---

### 2. Different roles, different work contexts

The system supported multiple operational user types, including:
- managers (desktop panel),
- operational staff (mobile panel),
- drivers / field teams (mobile panel).

Each role:
- had a different permission scope,
- worked on different data views,
- executed a different set of actions.

The access model had to be:
- precise,
- easy to reason about,
- maintainable in the long term.

---

### 3. Operability, auditability, and predictability

The system could not be a “black box”.

Every action:
- was validated before execution,
- recorded as an event,
- traceable in an operation history.

Auditability and action history were **critical** for daily operations and system maintenance.

---

### 4. Mobile work and fast data access

Some users interacted with the system **exclusively on mobile devices**.

This required:
- mobile-optimized interfaces,
- simple, unambiguous actions,
- fast order lookup,
- order identification via **QR code scanning using the phone camera**.

---

## Platform constraints

The project was implemented **entirely within WordPress + WooCommerce**, which imposed specific constraints:

- CMS lifecycle and hooks,
- shared environment with other plugins,
- strict backward compatibility requirements,
- high security expectations.

The solution had to be:
- platform-compliant,
- resilient to updates,
- evolvable without full rewrites.

---

## Architectural approach

A key decision was to treat **WordPress as an integration layer**, not as the center of operational logic.

### Layered structure:
- **CMS layer** – hooks, REST API, admin-post, WooCommerce integration.
- **Application layer** – workflows, validations, state transitions, operational rules.
- **Infrastructure layer** – persistence, event logging, document generation, external integrations.

This separation made it possible to:
- keep a large plugin maintainable,
- clearly define responsibilities,
- evolve the system iteratively.

---

## Operational panels (desktop and mobile)

The system exposed **multiple independent panels**, adapted to different work contexts.

### Manager panel (desktop)
- operational dashboards,
- order lists and filters,
- execution of operational actions,
- access to event history and audit data.

### Staff and driver panels (mobile)
- interfaces optimized for phones,
- fast order lookup,
- step-by-step process handling,
- **QR code scanning via the phone camera**,
- minimal interaction steps and clear feedback.

Users **did not log into WordPress admin** to perform operational work.

---

## State and event management

The system was built around a **state transition model**:
- user actions triggered controlled state changes,
- each change was recorded as an event,
- the event log served as the foundation for auditing.

Implemented mechanisms included:
- idempotency safeguards,
- pre-action validations,
- protection against duplicate processing.

---

## Documents and artifacts

Operational workflows included document generation (e.g. PDF):

- based on the current system state,
- using structured templates,
- executed in a repeatable and controlled manner.

Artifacts:
- were linked to operational events,
- could be stored locally or externally,
- were not part of critical business logic.

---

## Plugin administration panel

The plugin also provided a **dedicated administration panel** for technical administrators.

It allowed:
- managing plugin configuration,
- handling updates and data migrations,
- checking module and integration health,
- basic system diagnostics.

This made ongoing maintenance possible
without manual database or code intervention.

---

## Installation, updates, and maintenance

The plugin was designed for a **long operational lifecycle**:
- safe upgrades,
- automated data migrations,
- synchronization of roles and permissions.

This enabled:
- rolling out new versions without downtime,
- reducing operational risk,
- evolving the system while it was in active use.

---

## Final outcome

The result was a **robust operational plugin** that:
- extended WooCommerce with a missing operational layer,
- separated sales from fulfillment and operations,
- supported both desktop and mobile workflows,
- provided auditability and predictable behavior,
- evolved iteratively in a production environment.

The project demonstrated that even within **CMS platform constraints**, it is possible to build a mature, stable, and scalable operational system.

## Architecture showcase (GitHub)

This case study focuses on the **context, challenges, and outcomes** of the project.

If you want to go deeper — see how the system was structured,
where architectural boundaries were drawn, and which engineering decisions
and trade-offs shaped the solution — we prepared a dedicated
**architecture showcase**.

The repository covers:
- architectural layers and responsibilities,
- module layout and execution flows,
- key engineering decisions and trade-offs,
- approaches to operability, auditing, and long-term maintenance,

while intentionally omitting business-specific logic and sensitive details.
