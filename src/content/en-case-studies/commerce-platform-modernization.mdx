## System Context

This project concerns the modernization of a **proprietary online sales management platform**, designed and continuously developed by our team for approximately 10 years.

The system was originally built as an internal operational platform supporting a network of online stores operating across multiple European Union countries.

The platform serves as a centralized sales and integration system, enabling:

- integration of multiple online stores,
- integration with marketplaces (e.g., Amazon, eBay),
- order lifecycle management,
- shipping and carrier integrations,
- inventory and warehouse management,
- returns processing,
- service and warranty workflows,
- product listing management,
- invoice generation,
- operational reporting and analytics.

The system is multi-organization by design. Within a single instance, multiple organizations can operate independently, each with:

- their own sales platform integrations,
- their own operational configuration,
- their own user structure and permissions.

Within each organization, users operate under different access levels and operational roles.

The platform also automatically sends transactional and operational emails to customers and internal staff, functioning as a central operational communication hub.

## Why a Monolith Was the Right Decision 10 Years Ago

At the time of initial design:

- microservices architectures were not yet operational standards for mid-scale platforms,
- container orchestration infrastructure was not widely adopted,
- delivery speed and operational stability were primary objectives,
- the operational team required a single cohesive system to manage sales workflows.

Building a modular monolith was a deliberate architectural choice:

- a single deployable artifact,
- a shared runtime,
- a shared relational database,
- simplified deployments,
- full control over operational flows.

Over the years, this approach proved its business effectiveness.

The system was not experimental — it was a real operational tool supporting sales and logistics at scale.

---

## Why Modernization Is Necessary Today

After a decade of evolution, the system reached a natural architectural inflection point.

### 1. Increasing Integration Density

The platform integrates with:

- online stores,
- marketplaces,
- carriers,
- invoicing systems,
- communication mechanisms.

Over time, integration logic increased in density within key domain areas.

Formalizing boundaries became necessary to:

- reduce change blast radius,
- improve separation of concerns,
- enable independent evolution of high-I/O domains.

---

### 2. Shared Runtime Across Multiple Execution Contexts

The system handles:

- interactive HTTP requests,
- batch operations,
- scheduled scripts,
- deferred queue processing.

All of these execution paths share the same application runtime.

While historically operationally efficient, this model now limits flexibility and scalability.

---

### 3. Need for a Clear Frontend Boundary

Originally, the system functioned as a server-rendered operational interface.

Current requirements include:

- introducing a SPA layer,
- separating frontend contracts from internal domain models,
- establishing a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) boundary.

The BFF is treated as a core architectural component, not merely an HTTP adapter.

---

## Transformation Strategy

Modernization is led by the same team that designed and evolved the platform over the past decade.

The approach is evolutionary, not disruptive.

### Phase 1 – Boundary Formalization

- separating orchestration from state transitions,
- isolating integration adapters,
- introducing explicit contracts between layers.

The priority is establishing clarity before introducing physical service separation.

---

### Phase 2 – Extraction of High I/O Domains

Selected domain areas will be extracted into independent services.

Extraction sequencing is based on:

- integration density,
- orchestration complexity,
- change risk and operational impact.

This marks the beginning of the transition toward a microservices architecture.

---

### Phase 3 – Introduction of a BFF Layer

Before full SPA migration:

- existing JSON endpoints are formalized as contract boundaries,
- the BFF layer assumes responsibility for response shaping,
- frontend evolution becomes decoupled from domain internals.

---

### Phase 4 – Microservices Architecture Transformation

The target architecture includes:

- domain-focused independent services,
- dedicated execution contexts,
- separation between batch processing and interactive flows,
- independent scaling capabilities.

The transformation is conducted under live production conditions.

---

### Phase 5 – AI-Assisted Operational Augmentation

In the long term, the system will be extended with AI-assisted decision support.

AI will:

- operate exclusively on explicit contracts,
- generate recommendations and summaries,
- assist operational decisions,
- remain an augmentation layer rather than an execution authority.

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

- Modernization under active production usage.
- Operational continuity prioritized over rapid refactoring.
- Focus on boundary definition before runtime isolation.
- Extraction sequencing based on integration density rather than folder structure.
- Early establishment of contracts before service-level separation.

---

## Current State

The system remains fully operational.

Modernization is incremental:

- boundaries are being formalized,
- contracts are being strengthened,
- initial extraction candidates are being prepared.

This case study reflects a real production trajectory rather than an idealized end state.

---

## Current Outcome

The project demonstrates:

- responsible modernization of a production system,
- architectural evolution without operational disruption,
- long-term system thinking guided by domain continuity.

This is not a greenfield rewrite.

It is a production-proven operational platform being transformed in a controlled, contract-driven manner by the team that designed and operated it from inception.

## Architecture showcase (GitHub)

This case study describes the **context, evolution, and transformation strategy** of the system.

If you want to explore further — to see:
- how the modular monolith is structured today,
- which boundaries have been identified and formalized,
- how domain extraction toward microservices is sequenced,
- what architectural decisions and trade-offs guide the transformation,

we have prepared a dedicated **architecture showcase**.

The repository includes:

- runtime architecture and execution context description,
- module and integration mapping,
- step-by-step modernization model,
- domain boundary analysis,
- operational and evolutionary design considerations,

without exposing business logic or sensitive data.
